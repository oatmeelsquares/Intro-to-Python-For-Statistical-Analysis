# Intro-to-Python-For-Statistical-Analysis

This project exists as my preparation for a guest lecture at Hunter College on September 27, 2024. I was invited back on October 18, 2024 to continue/expand on the topic. All content covered in both lectures can be found in this repo.

The main file includes a brief introduction to each of the following:

- Python basics
  - Hello, World!
  - Basic operations
  - Variable assignment
- Data types
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Indexing
- `if` statements, loops and indentation in Python
- Intro to important modules:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - sklearn
 
Each section includes some high-level notes, code examples, and practice questions.

### Outcome

The student and professor gave positive feedback about the pace and clarity of the content. The student reported being comfortable enough after this lecture to explore Python on her own!

## How to use this resource

If you're interested in learning a little bit about Python, [py_lecture.ipynb](https://github.com/oatmeelsquares/Intro-to-Python-For-Statistical-Analysis/blob/main/py_lecture.ipynb) will walk you through everything you need to know to conduct a simple linear regression analysis.

- I recommend that you follow along in [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/). You can start by clicking the `+ Code` button in the top right-hand corner and typing some code! Use `Ctrl` + `Enter` to run the code block. Type out the code yourself and experiment with new things!
- In order for some of the code in `py_lecture.py` to work, you need to have `ef_slopes_and_discipline.csv` in the same directory. You can download it from this repo and [upload it into your Google Collab workspace](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PuChan-HCI/myweb/blob/main/colabo/UploadFiles.ipynb).
- This is far from a comprehensive guide. Use online resources or library books to gain a deeper understanding and troubleshoot issues when the code doesn't act like you think it should. Some informative websites include:
  - [the official python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
  - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
  - [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)
- This was intended to be taught as a lecture, so if something is confusing, feel free to reach out or create an issue!
